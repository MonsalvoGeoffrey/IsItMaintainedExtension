This is a chrome extension that grabs the results provided by [Is It Maintained](https://isitmaintained.com/) and displays them on the page of a GitHub repository.

It isn't currently ready for production, but is technically functional.

What still has to be worked on:
- [x] Detecting if the current page is indeed a GitHub repository
- [x] Properly styling the results

After that, the extension will be ready to be pushed to the Chrome Web Store.
